.. py:function:: mach_number(altitude, alt_units, speed)

   Calculate the Mach number of an object moving at a given altitude.

   Given an altitude, and assumptions of air composition, this function calculates the speed of sound in m/s in
   specific altitude using the formula: speed of sound = c = sqrt(gamma * R * T), where `gamma` and `R` are
   standard air properties, and `T` is the temperature at the given altitude. Then it calculates the Mach number
   of an object moving in said environment.
   The ratio of specific heats, gamma is 1.4.
   The gas constant R is 287.1 J/kg/K.
   Celsius to Kevin: Celsius + 273.15.

   Parameters:
   ------------
   altitude : float
       A numeric value that represents the altitude of interest. This value is the reference to extract air properties, specifically, temperature, pressure and density.
   alt_units : str
       Units of the altitude input to function. Valid units are: m (meters), km (kilometers), ft (feet), miles (miles).
   speed: float
       Speed of the object in m/s.

   Returns:
   ---------
   float
       The Mach number (adimensional) in specific altitude, calculated as: speed / speed of sound as calculated in speed_of_sound function.
